Cass is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biology at the University of Toronto Mississauga, and is cross-appointed as graduate faculty in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. She is a marine molecular ecologist and field biologist. Despite growing up in landlocked upstate NY, Cass somehow found her way to a career as a marine biologist in Southern Ontario. For her PhD, she studied larval dispersal in Belize with Pete Buston. During a brief hiatus from the field, she spent her postdoc years learning more about spatial ecology with Marie-Josee Fortin at the University of Toronto and theoretical ecology with Michael Neubert at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. 

Outside of work, Cass enjoys diving, vegetarian cooking, yoga, hiking, and hanging out with [Orla](/author/orla/).
